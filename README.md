# Yelp_Datasetv-API_Analysis


Completed as a part of UC Berkeley Extension Data Science cirriculum. Project one required us to use Python data science libraries to test a hypothesis. With the help of class mate Lauren Calso, we decieded to p-test Yelp data pulled from Kaggle against our own data set of similar data. Our data set was aquired via JSON extracted from Yelp's API that we formatted into a dataframe in Python. Our p-test found that conclusions based on either data set were not ideal and required larger sample sizes.
